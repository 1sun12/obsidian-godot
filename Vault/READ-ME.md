## About
---
The purpose of these notes is to collect my own personal data about the Godot game engine. If I forget how to do anything basic or information about it's API I hope to collect it here and reference it.

A place to store information on it's API, using the engine itself, basic tutorials, and other information about using the engine. 

The creation of these notes also just exists for the purpose of developing a long-term memory of this information, as, by just the action of collecting all this data only further reinforces it's contents in my noggin.
