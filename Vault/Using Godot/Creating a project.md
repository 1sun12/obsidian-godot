You can press `Cancel` if you're starting from scratch. Otherwise you can checkout the `Asset Library` to find free content to make your game with.

Next, you're going to hit `+ New` in the top left to start the creation process of a new project:

You will be greeted with this UI:

- Input a name for the project
- Input a folder to store the project in on your hard drive
- choose a renderer, which if you don't know what to pick just choose `Forward+`. `Mobile` is a better option for developing mobile games or products and `Compatibility` is good for building software or websites
- Choose a version control software, you'll probably be using `Git` or `Github`

Once all this data is filled out, and `Create & Edit` is clicked, you will be brought to a blank project which looks like this:

Congrats! You made a project.

Checkout [[Keyboard Controls]] to get familiarized with using the editor.
